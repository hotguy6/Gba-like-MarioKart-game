# Gba-like-MarioKart-game
This is a GBA like Mario Kart Like game made using codeHS. The goal of this project was to teach students how to Vibe-code effectively. For my project I created a mario kart like game. to meet the requirments I hade to:
- create a rough AI game using one promt only
- add/remove compents of the code so that it alligns with my vision

The game itself required:
- proper collision
- effective use of button and mouse listeners
- abstract classes and events
- good looking GUI/UI
  
These are most of the requirments for this project.

**What changed:** The AI code I got after one prompt was clearly incomplete and missing quite a bit as well as being riddled with bugs. One of the most notable was turning. The turning physics were clearly broken which made the initial game unplayable. While we were only allowed one prompt I did use AI a bit to help with the debugging especially considering that I had no idea what did what. After the turning was fixed I tried my best in adding some trees and rocks and stuff which kinda worked. The biggest issue is that the rocks would be on the track. I was eventually able to figure it out after a while. I had planned to add PNG images in the driver select page but ended up not doing it because, as always, PNGs proved to mess with other aspects of the code. Finally I added a login page. It works pretty well but if you reset the window the login information is also reset. The game itself is pretty fun and If I was better at coding I would have added the PNGs to the diver select as well as to the actual drives. Overall I feel pretty confident that I have at least met all of the expectations. My Mario Kart game successfully implements collision, mouse and button listeners, abstract classes and events as well as a pretty good looking GUI. The game itself is pretty fun as well, although there are only three tracks and the tracks themselves are pretty short. But in terms of effective use of Vibe coding I feel like I have met all the expectations.
