# Gba-like-MarioKart-game
This is a GBA like Mario Kart Like game made using codeHS. The goal of this project was to teach students how to Vibe-code effectively. For my project I created a mario kart like game. to meet the requirments I hade to:
- create a rough AI game using one promt only
- add/remove compents of the code so that it alligns with my vision

The game itself required:
- proper collision
- effective use of button and mouse listeners
- abstract classes and events
- good looking GUI/UI
  
These are most of the requirments for this project. I feel pretty confident that I have at least met all of them. My mario Kart game succssefuly implements collision, mouse and button listeners, abstract classes and events as well as a pretty good looking GUI. The game iself is pretty fun as well, although, there are only three tracks and the tracks themselves are pretty short. But interms of effective use of Vibe coding I fell like I have met all the expectations.
